          <h2>Conclusion of study</h2>
		  This study has demonstrated that the UI of Sonic The Hedgehog 1991 is fairly successful but is incredibly flawed. The main issue the game's UI has is
		  that it is heavily reliant on the intuition of the player and as such with no tutorial aspect to the game outside of manual. This is far from ideal as 
		  it lends itself to players not always acting as the designers intend. Looking further into it this issue is not isolated to Sonic The Hedgehog but is
		  prevalent among Japanese platformers of the era. 
		  
		  The data of this study due to its small sample cannot be used to make any overall conclusions but due to the consistency of data and standard deviations
		  the trends of the data make some interesting points. The first of these is that the lack of any tutorial resulted in those who had never played the game
		  ranking the game's clearness on the objective as low. The lack of feedback was also an issue with the average barely being passable at 56/100. While in other
		  areas the game did score high it is evident that there is room for improvement in the game's interface. The expert evaluation in the heuristic study proved to
		  find the same results as to the issues with the interface. The recommendations on the page aim to fix these major issues with the game's UX.
