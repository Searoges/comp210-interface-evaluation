          <h2>Quantitative Analysis</h2>
		  The study detailed here made use of a small sample of 27 people. This is not an ideal number and 
		  due to the limitations of such a number it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from this
		  data, as with such a small sample there will be no statistically significant data. This being said there are strong trends in the data that can be explored. The participants were
		  asked to complete a short online survey that included a link to an online port of the game as to allow
		  people who have never played the game to experience the game for the first time as to evaluate the
		  interface. 
		  
		  The survey makes use of 3 questions on demographics and 5 questions based upon a heuristic analysis. The survey was conducted online via Survey Monkey including an
		  online link to the game as to allow people to play the game. The data is then to be analysed to draw conclusions based upon the sample remembering the limitations of the data.
		  
		  The participants were asked to rank the heuristic features on a scale of 0 to 100, 100 being perfect and 0 being abysmal. Due to the nature of such an evaluation their gameplay experience
		  was also asked in the demographics as to determine the percentage of the sample that can be defined as expert users and this data can then be analysed interdependently to give a dedicated expert analysis.
		  
		  It is the view of this study that gender and age are irrelevant factors. The gender of a player does not effect the way the user will understand the interface as it is merely an analysis of the interface
		  not the overall game. The age of the participants has much the same connotations, the age of a player does not effect how clear aspects of the interface are or how well they are designed. While interesting
		  conclusions could be drawn from this information it is the view of this study that these would be simply correlations and not relevant to the conclusion of this study.

          <h2>Heuristic Analysis</h2>
		  While the survey serves to provide a volume of quantitative data the analysis strives to provide a qualitative analysis of the same interface making use of 3 experts on games that have played games, especially
			legacy games and have a broad understanding of interfaces. The heuristic analysis serves to provide a more detailed response to how well Sonic The Hedgehog executes it's GUI and how successful it is in its
			usability. It should of course be noted that just as with the survey this will be using the flash based browser port rather than the original megadrive release and as such there will be aspects that are not
			100% as they should be. 
			
			The heuristic will take place with the players playing the game for 10 minutes and then completing a heuristic evaluation on the game as to determine their thoughts on the game's interface and how well it was executed.
