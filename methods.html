          <h2>Sample</h2>
		  The study detailed here made use of a small sample of 27 people. This is not an ideal number and 
		  due to the limitations of such a number it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from this
		  data, this being said there are strong trends in the data that can be explored. The participants were
		  asked to complete a short online survey that included a link to an online port of the game as to allow
		  people who have never played the game to experience the game for the first time as to evaluate the
		  interface. 
		  <img src = "images/howOften.png" alt = "How often do the participants play games?"/>
		  The data above shows how often the participants play games "Always" begin defined as incredibly often usually
		  many times a day, this is where 55.6%  of the sample are found with a single person not being a gamer. This 
		  has an impact on the data as regular players will have expectations of an interface but also a level of intuition
		  as to how a game should play.
		  <img src = "images/system.png" alt = "What systems do the participants primarily use?" />
		  The participants where then asked to identify which system they primarily play on, this yielded some interesting results
		  as over 50% of the sample identified as primarily playing on the PC platform be it desktop or laptop. With only 1 primarily
		  making use of older legacy systems and none for the mobile/tablet or 3DS. This last one is the most interesting as with 
		  no primary users of the mobile/tablet section of the market it does not reveal anything for the game on a portable platform,
		  while multiple participants primarily use the Nintendo Switch it does not grant the insight that mobile/tablet gamers would 
		  have done.
		  <img src = "images/played.png" alt = "Have they played the game prior to this evaluation?" />
		  It was critical to identify if the players had ever played the game prior to the evaluation. Those who have played prior
		  will have insights to be able to give more than a snapshot answer but will also look at the game incredibly differently to 
		  new players due to knowing the game's interface it will be a more trained response rather than the natural one from the 11.1%
		  of participants who had never played the game before.
