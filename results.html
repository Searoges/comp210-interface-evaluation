		  <img src = "images/howOften.PNG" alt = "How often do the participants play games?"/>
		  The data above shows how often the participants play games "Always" begin defined as incredibly often usually
		  many times a day, this is where 55.6%  of the sample are found with a single person not being a gamer. This 
		  has an impact on the data as regular players will have expectations of an interface but also a level of intuition
		  as to how a game should play.
		  <img src = "images/system.PNG" alt = "What systems do the participants primarily use?" />
		  The participants where then asked to identify which system they primarily play on, this yielded some interesting results
		  as over 50% of the sample identified as primarily playing on the PC platform be it desktop or laptop. With only 1 primarily
		  making use of older legacy systems and none for the mobile/tablet or 3DS. This last one is the most interesting as with 
		  no primary users of the mobile/tablet section of the market it does not reveal anything for the game on a portable platform,
		  while multiple participants primarily use the Nintendo Switch it does not grant the insight that mobile/tablet gamers would 
		  have done.
		  <img src = "images/played.PNG" alt = "Have they played the game prior to this evaluation?" />
		  It was critical to identify if the players had ever played the game prior to the evaluation. Those who have played prior
		  will have insights to be able to give more than a snapshot answer but will also look at the game incredibly differently to 
		  new players due to knowing the game's interface it will be a more trained response rather than the natural one from the 11.1%
		  of participants who had never played the game before.
		  <img src = "images/aim.PNG" alt = "How well is the aim of the game conveyed?" />
		  The aim of Sega's Sonic The Hedgehog is to run through the level from left to right avoiding enemies and obstacles along the way. 
		  Like most Japanese platformers from the 1980's and 90's such as Mario and Mega Man. The average result from the sample group was 76/100.
		  According to the sample group this means that Sonic The Hedgehog does a good job of displaying the objective. This is interesting as
		  the games does not tell you what to do directly nor does it have a tutorial level to teach you. This data has a standard deviation of 24.58
		  as such even within standard deviation it does a passable job of this. This lends to the idea that the simple left to right objective of the 
		  game is incredibly intuitive and would likely be a players first assumption. One of the main factors that may encourage this is that by default
		  Sonic looks towards the right, implying that this is the direction to move in. This plays on the way that in the west we read and write from 
		  left to right on the page likely making this an ingrained behavior in the sample of western players. None of this can be confirmed with the 
		  available data but it is a hypothesis that could be further explored with more data.
